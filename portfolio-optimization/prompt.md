### Dataset 7: Portfolio Historical Optimization Reports
*Unstructured internal emails and analyst notes; key excerpts are provided below.*

"Email from Lead Analyst, 15 Mar 2023: 'Our simulations indicate that increasing fixed income and hedge fund exposures by 5-10% reduces overall volatility. However, equities still drive returns—balance is key.'"

"Analyst Note, 22 Feb 2023: 'Stress testing under commodity shocks shows significant drawdowns if commodity allocations exceed 10%. Diversification across alternative investments can hedge tail risks.'"

### Dataset 8: Market Sentiment and Geopolitical Outlook
*This unstructured dataset includes a transcript excerpt from a recent conference call with institutional clients discussing geopolitical risks and currency fluctuations.*

"Conference Call Transcript, 30 Jan 2023:  
Client: 'We are increasingly worried about rising geopolitical tensions and their potential impact on emerging markets.'  
Analyst: 'Indeed, adjusting exposure toward assets with lower geopolitical sensitivity—like quality bonds and certain hedge funds—might be prudent.'"

## Question
You are a financial analyst tasked with optimizing a multi-asset portfolio for a global investment firm. The firm seeks to maximize returns while managing risk across asset classes that include equities, fixed income, commodities, and alternative investments. Using the provided datasets:

1. Identify the optimal portfolio allocation that maximizes a risk-adjusted performance metric (such as the Sharpe Ratio) while adhering to the risk constraints (max 25% exposure per asset, portfolio volatility not exceeding 12%, and a VaR threshold of 5% at 95% confidence).

2. Recommend risk management strategies considering market volatility, tail risk, and geopolitical uncertainties. Justify your asset allocations based on historical performance, correlation insights, and macroeconomic indicators.

3. Evaluate potential stress scenarios (e.g., interest rate hikes, commodity price shocks, and equity drawdowns) and propose hedge mechanisms or diversification tactics.

## Instruction
Please provide a detailed, step-by-step solution including all intermediate calculations and rationale. Reference specific data points from the datasets to support your conclusions. Begin your solution with a brief executive summary that outlines the key findings, including optimal asset weights, expected portfolio performance, and recommended risk management strategies. Use markdown formatting for all tables, charts, and figures you include.
