The initial estimate is \$12,000 in structural repairs (drywall, flooring) and \$2,000 in personal property. There’s also mold growth behind the cabinets. The policy has a \$3,000 limit for mold coverage. Does our policy fully cover this claim, and what are the next steps to finalize the settlement?”
