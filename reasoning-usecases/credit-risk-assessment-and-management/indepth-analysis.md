Comparison of GPT-4O-2024-11-20 and O1 Model Responses
The o1 model provided a more thorough and cautious assessment by acknowledging the absence of the composite rating "ABACB" in the provided policy table and making logical assumptions based on available data. In contrast, the gpt-4o-2024-11-20 model assumed the composite rating was directly available, potentially leading to inaccuracies. The o1 model demonstrated strength in attention to detail and adherence to data limitations, which is crucial in financial decision-making. While gpt-4o-2024-11-20 responded faster, the accuracy and careful analysis of the o1 model make it more reliable for tasks requiring precise data interpretation. Correct data handling is vital in credit risk assessment to avoid costly errors. Therefore, the o1 model is recommended for this task due to its meticulous approach. Financial institutions should prioritize accuracy over speed when evaluating loan applications.
