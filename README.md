### ðŸ“˜ [Global Multi-Asset Portfolio Optimization](./portfolio-optimization/README.md)
Optimizes asset allocation across a diversified global portfolio while meeting regulatory risk limits. Highlights O1â€™s ability to handle high-dimensional financial datasets and justify recommendations using correlations and constraints.

### ðŸ“˜ [Commercial Insurance Underwriting](./underwriting-analysis/README.md)
Conducts risk-adjusted premium analysis using historical claims, inspection reports, and compliance data. Illustrates O1â€™s strength in synthesizing multi-source data for commercial insurance underwriting.

### ðŸ“˜ [Personalized Banking Insights for Client Retention](./customer-relationship-management/README.md)
Analyzes behavior, transaction patterns, and customer feedback to recommend tailored banking services. Demonstrates O1â€™s ability to distill actionable client insights from structured and semi-structured financial datasets.

### ðŸ“˜ [Credit Risk Assessment and Management](./credit-risk-assessment-and-management/README.md)
Assesses borrower creditworthiness using repayment history, credit scores, and regulatory thresholds. Highlights O1â€™s strength in transparent scoring, compliance flagging, and precise lending classification.

### ðŸ“˜ [Fraud Detection and Compliance Triggers](./fraud-detection-and-prevention/README.md)
Uses behavioral anomalies, transaction metadata, and rule-based compliance filters to flag potential fraud cases. Designed to demonstrate O1â€™s interpretability in high-stakes forensic audits and compliance workflows.




# Executing the notebook to compare model outputs

To run the notebook, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/reasoning-llms-fsi-lab.git
    cd reasoning-llms-fsi-lab
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Copy the `env_sample` file to `.env` and add your Azure OpenAI endpoint and API key:
    ```sh
    cp env_sample .env
    ```

    Edit the `.env` file to add your Azure OpenAI endpoint and API key:
    ```plaintext
    AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=your_endpoint
    AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
    ```

5. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the cells and observe the results.
