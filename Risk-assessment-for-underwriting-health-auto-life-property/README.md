## 🧠 What Does the Underwriter Need To Do?

The model must act as a **compliance-aware underwriter** and:

1. **Calculate Risk Scores**
   - Assign weighted risk points based on:
     - Prior violations
     - Claims frequency
     - Telematics behavior
     - Credit health

2. **Evaluate Eligibility**
   - Decide whether John Miller qualifies for standard premium coverage
   - Or whether surcharges or special monitoring are needed

3. **Explain Decision with Traceability**
   - Every decision must be backed by specific dataset citations
   - Intermediate calculations should be shown for audit purposes

4. **Deliver a Structured Report**
   - Begin with an executive summary
   - Provide risk justification by dataset
   - End with a decision recommendation and next steps

## 🎯 Example Outcomes

- **Risk Score**: Total points = 7 (Moderate Risk Tier)
- **Decision**: Eligible for coverage with a 10% surcharge and required usage-based monitoring for 12 months
- **Dataset Highlights**:
  - Telematics shows 6 harsh braking events in June
  - Strong credit score (720) offsets some risk
  - Defensive driving course mentioned in call transcript (mitigating factor)
