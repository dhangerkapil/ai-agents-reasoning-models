## 🧐 What Does the Underwriter Need To Do?

The underwriter (you) is asked to:

1. **Compute Risk-Adjusted Premiums**
   - Calculate risk multipliers based on historical claim data
   - Adjust for open claims, severity, and frequency

2. **Build a Composite Risk Matrix**
   - Combine Risk Survey (Dataset 3) + Inspection (Dataset 4)
   - Apply transparent weighting logic for fire, equipment, and theft

3. **Apply State Compliance Loadings**
   - Identify penalties due to non-compliance (e.g., outdated sprinklers)
   - Use Dataset 5 to inform surcharges

4. **Assess Financial and Operational Stability**
   - Examine revenue patterns (Dataset 7)
   - Incorporate qualitative intent to comply (Dataset 8)
   - Evaluate employee morale (Dataset 9)

5. **Recommend Final Premium and Mitigations**
   - Provide a precise final adjustment percentage
   - Suggest steps like updating sprinklers, staff training, etc.
