## 🧩 What Information Is Used?

The insurance consultant has access to several structured and semi-structured datasets:

### ✅ 1. Business Profile (Dataset 1)
Includes critical context like:
- Location: Tampa, FL (a hurricane-prone zone)
- Business Type: Bakery/Café
- Revenue: $850,000/year
- Key risks: weather damage, liability, digital security, cost management

### ✅ 2. Risk Audit Report (Dataset 2)
Quantifies exposure and incidents over the past 2 years:
- **Weather Damage**: High risk score (9), with actual past damage
- **Slip-and-Fall Liability**: Medium-high score (7), with 4 incidents
- **Workers' Comp**: Medium risk (6), with 3 injury reports
- **Cybersecurity**: Lower but present risk (score 5)

### ✅ 3. Florida Insurance Law Highlights (Dataset 3)
Includes:
- Rules on flood and hurricane endorsements
- State-mandated workers’ comp coverage minimums
- Required disclosures on windstorm deductibles

### ✅ 4. Industry Premium Benchmarks (Dataset 4)
Gives estimated premium ranges and suggested policy limits for:
- Property
- Liability
- Cyber
- Business Interruption
- Workers’ Comp
- Flood (optional add-on)

### ⚠️ 5. Distractor Datasets (5 & 6)
These include:
- Monthly bakery ingredient usage
- Competitor sales figures

These are clearly **non-essential** and help evaluate the model's ability to **filter signal from noise** — a key strength of the O1 model.

## 🧠 What Does the Consultant Need To Do?

The AI must use these datasets to:
1. Identify **core and optional coverage needs** for this business, with realistic limits.
2. Reference **specific regulations** to justify add-ons like commercial flood or cyber protection.
3. Use **past incidents and risk scores** to drive recommendations.
4. Suggest **ways to reduce premiums**, such as risk mitigation steps or bundling opportunities.
5. Present everything in a structured and traceable format.

The consultant must **explain every decision** and avoid vague conclusions — this is about **precision, traceability, and regulatory alignment**.

## 🎯 Example Outcomes

The final output should include:

- **Core Coverages**:
  - **Commercial Property**: $2M, based on storm damage history and industry norms (Dataset 2, Dataset 4)
  - **General Liability**: $1M per incident, citing slip-and-fall incidents (Dataset 2)

- **Add-Ons**:
  - **Commercial Flood**: Recommended based on FL exclusions (Dataset 3)
  - **Cyber Liability**: Justified due to digital payments risk (Dataset 1, Dataset 2)

- **Premium Estimates**: Pulled directly from Dataset 4

- **Risk Mitigation Advice**:
  - Install hurricane shutters → may reduce property premiums
  - Implement safety training → reduce liability risk

Each suggestion is **backed by real values** from the datasets — no fluff or filler.
