You are an expert insurance consultant with extensive knowledge of state regulations, small-business risk management, and commercial insurance underwriting. 

Read the following background carefully, then produce a detailed insurance plan recommendation. 

Background: 
- The client, Sarah Barnes, runs a bakery/café in Tampa, Florida, with 12 employees and annual revenue of $850,000. 
- Key concerns: hurricane damage, slip-and-fall liability, workers’ compensation, potential cyber threats from digital payment systems, and managing costs. 

Task: 
1. Identify the necessary core coverage types (e.g., Commercial Property, General Liability, Workers’ Compensation) along with recommended policy limits. 
2. Provide an optional “add-on” coverage list relevant to a bakery/café in a hurricane-prone area (e.g., Commercial Flood Insurance, Business Interruption Insurance, Cyber Liability Coverage). 
3. Estimate an illustrative premium range for each coverage type, keeping in mind her budget constraints. 
4. Offer specific steps and advice on how to reduce premiums (e.g., risk mitigation, safety protocols, bundling discounts). 
5. Ensure any details about Florida regulations or specific coverage exclusions are highlighted in plain language. 
6. Summarize in a concise, bullet-point format. 

Be as specific as possible. For example, if recommending Business Interruption Insurance, indicate typical coverage triggers (e.g., mandatory evacuation orders for hurricanes, physical property damage), typical coverage duration, and approximate cost ratio relative to annual revenue.
