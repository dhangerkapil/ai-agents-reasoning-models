## Concise Summary

Both answers are strong, detailed, and data-driven. However, Answer 1 stands out as the more comprehensive and traceable response because it:
- Offers a robust multi-dataset synthesis by explicitly incorporating social media sentiment and additional online engagement data.
- Provides a clearer, highly structured layout with strong visual separators and detailed justifications.
- Demonstrates exceptional analytical depth through explicit segmentation of client behaviors with well-linked cross-references.

Thus, Answer 1 is the superior response for driving client-specific loyalty enhancements in an audit-ready format.
